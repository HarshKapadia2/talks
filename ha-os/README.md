# Implementing High Availability for MAAS-based Automated OS Installs

## Talk Details

-   Abstract: This talk will go over why and how I implemented high availability for a system that automates OS installs for servers. I will talk about how Canonical's MAAS server lifecycle management tool manages core services like DNS, DHCP, DB, PXE, HTTP proxy, API server and OS images, and how I implemented automated failovers and backups for some of these critical services.
