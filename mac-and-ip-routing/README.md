# MAC and IP Routing

-   Talk duration: ~1 hr
-   Abstract
    -   It is not intuitive to understand why MAC addresses are required for routing when IP addresses exist and how both MAC addresses and IP addresses work together to get packets/frames to their final destinations. This talk aims to demystify this.
